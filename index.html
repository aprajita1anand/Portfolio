                    <p>I got intrest in wed development when i was in my first year i want to know about how these wedsites were created so I started by learning the basics of HTML and CSS, and I found the process of designing and building web pages incredibly satisfying. As I delved deeper, I discovered the endless possibilities and creativity that web development offers. It was fascinating to see how a few lines of code could turn into a fully functional and visually appealing website.</p>
